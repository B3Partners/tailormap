## Supported Versions

The project supports the last stable releases (built from the specific version branch) and 
the last(latest) community release (cut from the `master` branch).
As we are working on a new Tailormap product based on a differnt tech-stack this project is 
in maintainance mode only.

At the time of writing (October 2022) the support matrix looks as follows:
